          reliance on oral advice, draft reports or conclusions or advice,
          issued by us as these may be subject to further work, revision or to

          been provided, shall we assume any liability or responsibility to any
          third party to whom any advice or report is disclosed or otherwise

          guaranteed to be secure or error free and such information could be
          intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed, arrive late or be incomplete
          or otherwise be adversely affected or unsafe to use. We agree to use
          reasonable procedures to check for the most commonly known viruses
          before sending information electronically, but we recognise that such
          procedures cannot be a guarantee that transmission will be virus free.
